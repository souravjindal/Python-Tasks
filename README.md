- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

## Task 2: Personalized Greeting
- Takes user's first and last name
- Prints a personalized welcome message

ASSIGNMENT 2:

Task 3: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.

Task 4: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

ASSIGNMENT 3:

Task 5: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 


Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.

ASSIGNMENT 4:
Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.
